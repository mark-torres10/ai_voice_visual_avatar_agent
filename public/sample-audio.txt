# Sample Audio Assets

This directory is for storing audio assets that can be used with the D-ID avatar video generation.

## Usage

1. Place your audio files (MP3, WAV) in this directory
2. Serve them via a web server to make them publicly accessible
3. Use the public URLs in your video generation requests

## Example

If you place a file named `welcome.mp3` in this directory and serve it via:
- Express static middleware: `http://localhost:3001/welcome.mp3`
- Or upload to a CDN/cloud storage for production use

## Supported Formats

- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- M4A
- AAC

## Requirements

- Audio files must be publicly accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
- Recommended duration: 5-60 seconds
- Quality: 16kHz, mono or stereo

## Example Audio URLs for Testing

These are publicly available test audio files you can use:

```
https://d-id-public-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/sample_audio.wav
```

Replace with your own audio files for production use.
